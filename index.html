      The <b>Lab</b> at <b>UC San Francisco</b> develops
      high-throughput molecular techniques to study gene regulation. We are
      funded through the <a href="https://fellows.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Sandler Fellows</a> program, and are located in <b>Genentech Hall</b>
      on UCSF's <b>Mission Bay</b> campus.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are always looking for motivated graduate students and postdocs! UCSF graduate students and prospective postdocs should <a href="mailto:vijay.ramani@ucsf.edu">contact me</a> to talk about potential projects.
