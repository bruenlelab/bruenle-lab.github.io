  description: "I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early \"pre-leukemic\" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease."

  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area, then moved to the midwest to study Neuroscience and Psychological & Brain Sciences at Washington
  University in St. Louis. There, I joined the lab of Yehuda Ben-Shahar to study how homologs of genes that cause Williams Syndrome, a
  human developmental condition characterized by hypersociability, affect social behavior in Drosophila melanogaster. I graduated in 2019, 
  and after continuing on as lab manager for a year, I joined the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at UCSF. Now, as part of the Corces
  Lab, I am pivoting to study human patient data directly, and using cellular models to understand the etiology of neurodegenerative and
  neuropsychiatric diseases at genomic and epigenetic levels."

  description: "Growing up in rural Rhode Island, I was raised in the outdoors and turned this into a passion for biology with the help
  of dedicated early educators. Deciding to make a career out of this, I made the trek to Providence to study Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology at Brown University. There, I began my journey in research in the lab of Ashley Webb, investigating how the Forkhead Box O family
  of transcription factors (FOXOs) regulate stem cell homeostasis in the brain. I concurrently examined this functionality under
  physiological and pathological conditions, focusing the majority of my efforts on investigating a role for FOXOs in the maintenance of
  cancer stem cell quiescence in the context of high-grade brain cancer. Wanting to continue research on human disease, I switched coasts
  after graduation to pursue my PhD in the Biomedical Sciences Program at UCSF. Here, as a member of the Corces Lab, I aim to pair
  multi-omics with organoid and iPSC-based model systems to pinpoint and validate the epigenetic underpinnings driving AD and PD.
  In particular, I am interested in the interplay between such drivers and their contextual relationships in a cell-type and cell-state
  specific manner. Outside of lab, you'll find me working with UCSF's Science Education Partnership, exploring new ways to consume coffee,
  or making my way to a beach or a mountain."

  description: "I grew up in Idaho, born to Argentinian parents. After falling in love with biology late in high school thanks to Campbell Biology's
  Tour of the Cell chapter, I went to Washington State University (WSU) to pursue a bachelor's in biochemistry. While at WSU, I fell in love with
  genome regulation while working on transposable elements and the variety of ways they create genomic and epigenetic variation.  In 2014, I graduated
  and went on to pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford University in the lab of Nidhi Bhutani. There, I studied DNA methylation, specifically the regulation of
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics by the TET family of enzymes in the context of skeletal development and disease, including dissecting the relationship
  between 5hmC deposition and SOX9 transcription factor activity. During graduate school, I also became interested in pursuing the use of single-cell
  technologies to understand how the epigenome shapes cell fate, and specifically how it can store information about environmental conditions like chronic
  inflammation that cause disease. Now, I'm combing these two interests to study mechanisms of resilience to AD in the Corces lab."

 the ecology of benthic cyanobacterial mats. I'm broadly interested in the way evolutionary processes have shaped mechanisms for gene regulation."

  families in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. While working at the lab during the summer, I got an opportunity to volunteer as a computer
  science teacher at Camp Promise, a summer camp for people with muscular dystrophy, which sparked my interest in disease genomics. After graduating
  in 2018, I started my PhD in computer science at Stanford, where I am advised by Anshul Kundaje. Currently, I am working on using machine learning
  to identify cell type-specific functional non-coding variants that impact neurodegenerative diseases, and I am collaborating with the Corces Lab to
  validate our findings using high-throughput experiments."

  description: "I am a high school student at The Harker School in San Jose, California. Growing up in the Bay Area, I was exposed to computer science
  at an early age through competitions, courses, and events all around me. My introduction to neurodegenerative diseases came later at the start of
  high school, when I wrote an essay with Dr. Peter Tass on vibrotactile coordinated reset neuromodulation, his novel, non-intrusive treatment for
  Parkinson's Disease. Following that experience, I spent two years researching and developing an audiovisual emotion classification platform powered
  by deep neural networks to help individuals with autism. Now, as part of the Corces Lab, I'm combining my interests in machine learning and
  neurological diseases to predict the effect of non-coding variants in Alzheimer's Disease and create a tool for researchers to test their own
  variants of interest. Outside of the lab, I enjoy filmmaking, graphics design, hip-hop dance, and debate."

  While there, under the mentorship of Dr. Wesley Cain, I studied dynamical systems, specifically in surveying approaches for analyzing delay-induced stability
  and instability. I also had the opportunity to do clinical cytogenetics research in Dr. Cynthia Morton's lab where we sought to better understand position
  effects and balanced chromosomal abnormalities. In 2020, I moved across the country to start in the Medical Scientist Training Program at UCSF. In graduate
  school, I hope to bring together my background in mathematics with my interest in genetics to use and develop analytical techniques to help better
  understand how the epigenome influences disease pathology. Outside of the lab, I enjoy trying new foods, going for long walks, and baking."
