  description: "I graduated from Princeton University in 2008 with a major in Molecular Biology and a minor in Computer Science. While at Princeton,
  I worked under the mentorship of [Coleen Murphy](https://murphylab.princeton.edu/), studying *C. elegans* aging. During the summers I had relatively foundational scientific experiences
  studying learning and memory (with [Cristina Alberini](http://alberinilab.org/)), and epigenetics (with [Or Gozani](https://gozani-lab-website.github.io/website/index.html)).


  After graduation, I spent a year living with family in Spain and teaching science to bilingual elementary schools students. In 2009, I started my Ph.D. in the Cancer Biology
  program at Stanford University under the mentorship of [Ravi Majeti](http://med.stanford.edu/majetilab.html). Together with Max Jan and Thomas Snyder, we provided the first genetic and cellular proof that AML evolves from
  sequential acquisition of mutations in a hematopoietic stem cell. We went on to identify patterns to this mutational evolution, with mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as
  DNMT3A or TET2 occurring universally during the early \"pre-leukemic\" phase of the disease.


  These findings led me to pursue postdoctoral training in epigenetics with [Howard Chang](http://med.stanford.edu/changlab.html) at Stanford University. With Jason Buenrostro,
  we applied the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) to understand normal hematopoietic differentiation and leukemic transformation. This
  highlighted the utility of this technology for understanding complex cellular processes and we subsequently applied ATAC-seq to a cohort of 410 different tumor samples
  spanning 23 cancer types in collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas.


  At about the half-way point of my postdoctoral work, I switched gears to study the genetic and epigenetic underpinnings of neurodegenerative diseases. Co-mentored by
  [Thomas Montine](https://www.montinelab.com/index.html), I used multi-omic epigenetic approaches to dissect the role of inherited variation in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
  disease. This work serves as the launching point of the lab, driving our interest in using the epigenome to better understand neurological disease."

  description: "I was born in Taiwan and moved to the Bay Area when I was twelve to study piano performance at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Pre-College. My
  love for music then took me to Columbia University in NYC, where I could be challenged intellectually while still being a part of the classical music scene. At Columbia,
  soaking up everything like a sponge, I quickly discovered the elegance and beauty of biology, especially how neuronal patterns of activity give rise to sensory and behavioral responses.
  From there, I decided to pursue a bachelor's in Neuroscience and Behavior and began my research journey in the lab of Richard Axel, studying the functional architecture
  of innate olfactory avoidance in Drosophila Melanogaster. I focused on the V glomerulus and the DA2 glomerulus, which are glomeruli that detect CO2 and geosmin, to
  understand how aversive channels elicit aversive behaviors. Through the experience, I gained a deep appreciation for brain systems and the intricacies of systems biology.
  I also yearn to see how basic science findings can transform into applied therapeutics in a precision context. Now at the Corces Lab, I am working towards that goal by
  delving into the underpinnings of neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases through a gene-regulatory and cell type-mechanistic lens. I am interested in using
  single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics, alongside massively parallel reporter assays, to prioritize noncoding SNPs that are associated with the disease."

  and after continuing on as lab manager for a year, I joined the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program at UCSF. Now, as part of the Corces

  description: "Growing up in rural Rhode Island, I was raised in the outdoors and turned this into a passion for biology with the help
  of dedicated early educators. Deciding to make a career out of this, I made the trek to Providence to study Biochemistry and Molecular
  Biology at Brown University. There, I began my journey in research in the lab of Ashley Webb, investigating how the Forkhead Box O family
  of transcription factors (FOXOs) regulate stem cell homeostasis in the brain. I concurrently examined this functionality under
  physiological and pathological conditions, focusing the majority of my efforts on investigating a role for FOXOs in the maintenance of
  cancer stem cell quiescence in the context of high-grade brain cancer. Wanting to continue research on human disease, I switched coasts
  after graduation to pursue my PhD in the Biomedical Sciences Program at UCSF. Here, as a member of the Corces Lab, I aim to pair
  multi-omics with organoid and iPSC-based model systems to pinpoint and validate the epigenetic underpinnings driving AD and PD.
  In particular, I am interested in the interplay between such drivers and their contextual relationships in a cell-type and cell-state
  specific manner. Outside of lab, you'll find me working with UCSF's Science Education Partnership, exploring new ways to consume coffee,
  or making my way to a beach or a mountain."

  description: "I grew up in Idaho, born to Argentinian parents. After falling in love with biology late in high school thanks to Campbell Biology's
  Tour of the Cell chapter, I went to Washington State University (WSU) to pursue a bachelor's in biochemistry. While at WSU, I fell in love with
  genome regulation while working on transposable elements and the variety of ways they create genomic and epigenetic variation.  In 2014, I graduated
  and went on to pursue a Ph.D. at Stanford University in the lab of Nidhi Bhutani. There, I studied DNA methylation, specifically the regulation of
  5-hydroxymethylcytosine dynamics by the TET family of enzymes in the context of skeletal development and disease, including dissecting the relationship
  between 5hmC deposition and SOX9 transcription factor activity. During graduate school, I also became interested in pursuing the use of single-cell
  technologies to understand how the epigenome shapes cell fate, and specifically how it can store information about environmental conditions like chronic
  inflammation that cause disease. Now, I'm combing these two interests to study mechanisms of resilience to AD in the Corces lab."
