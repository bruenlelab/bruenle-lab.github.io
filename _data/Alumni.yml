  description: "I grew up in the Bay Area and studied Molecular & Cell Biology and German at the University of California, Berkeley. My introduction
  to biology research was in Oskar Hallatschek's lab, where I worked with Dr. Jona Kayser on recombination-based tools for studying mechanical effects
  in microbial evolution. Since then, I'e studied transcriptional regulation in mammalian development, the role of evolution in tumor metastasis, and
  the ecology of benthic cyanobacterial mats. I'm broadly interested in the way evolutionary processes have shaped mechanisms for gene regulation."

  description: "From a young age, I was always interested in science, especially the science behind different diseases. I majored in Biomedical
  Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin to learn more about the real-world applications of scientific and medical research. At UT, I joined
  Dr. Aaron Baker's lab and studied nerve damage after traumatic injury. There, I helped engineer and test neural microelectrodes, and I also published
  an undergraduate thesis on drug delivery methods that could speed up nerve regrowth. Now, in the Corces lab, I work on neurodegeneration in a different
  context as it relates to the epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. My research experience has ignited in me a
  fascination with the brain, and I aim to join a neuroscience PhD program in the future."
