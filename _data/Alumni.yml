  description: "I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 2019 with a major in Microbiology and a
  minor in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. While at Penn State, I worked as a medical scribe in the emergency department. There I frequently saw
  patients with chronic illnesses, including neurodegenerative diseases, which I found most interesting to study. From there, I joined the Corces Lab
  as an administrative assistant, where I use my organizational skills to help in neurodegenerative disease research."

  description: "From a young age, I was always interested in science, especially the science behind different diseases. I majored in Biomedical
  Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin to learn more about the real-world applications of scientific and medical research. At UT, I joined
  Dr. Aaron Baker's lab and studied nerve damage after traumatic injury. There, I helped engineer and test neural microelectrodes, and I also published
  an undergraduate thesis on drug delivery methods that could speed up nerve regrowth. Now, in the Corces lab, I work on neurodegeneration in a different
  context as it relates to the epigenetics of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. My research experience has ignited in me a
  fascination with the brain, and I aim to join a neuroscience PhD program in the future."
