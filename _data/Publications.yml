  description: 'We develop a machine learning classifier to integrate multi-omic epigenetic data and predict dozens of functional SNPs,
  nominating gene and cellular targets for previously orphaned GWAS loci. These predictions both inform well-studied disease-relevant genes,
  such as BIN1 in microglia for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and reveal novel gene-disease associations, such as STAB1 in microglia and MAL in
  oligodendrocytes for Parkinson’s disease (PD). This work greatly expands our understanding of inherited variation in AD and PD and provides
  a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of noncoding regulatory variation in disease.'
