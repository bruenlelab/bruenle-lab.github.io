  description: '__Omni-ATAC__ is a carefully optimized ATAC-seq method that provides improvements on data quality, cost, and generalizability.
  It works on every cell type that we have tested, from cell lines to flash frozen tissues. The original protocol can be found as
  [Supplementary Protocol 1](/pdfs/OmniATAC_Protocol.pdf) of Corces et al. Nature Methods 2017 and an __updated protocol for nuclei
  isolation from frozen tissue__ can be found [on protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/isolation-of-nuclei-from-frozen-tissue-for-atac-se-6t8herw).'

  [GEO](). This data comes from cognitively healthy individuals. We have also set up a WashU Epigenome Browser
  [track hub of cell type-specific chromatin accessibility]() as well
  as a HiGlass [track hub of all bulk ATAC-seq datasets from the publication]().'

  Data in the form of aligned hg38 BAM files from our 2018 collaboration with The Cancer Genome Atlas are available through the
  [Genomic Data Commons Data Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) with approved access requested through
  [dbGaP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000178.v11.p8). Select processed files including bigwigs,
